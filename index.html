<p>I am the principal researcher at a robo-advisor company.</p> 
  
<p>For the past five years, I I have been worked day and night at start-ups to strive to share the asset management service that was otherwise available only to a handful of institutional investors and a few wealthy people.</p>
   
<p>As a result, my team and I launched Korea’s first robo-advising service which offers financial services for clients, including small investors (individuals) who invest their hard-earned life-long savings with stakes as small as $200. The robo-advisor, born with the algorithm that I programmed, is immensely successful with over 1 million users. As a result, the company grew – to over 100 employees from only 20 on the payroll, while its value increased by almost 200 times – stellar growth indeed (now the largest in the market). As for me, I also grew as I wrote five papers (while working) and secured patents for my algorithms. </p>
  
<p><strong>But I am only getting started.</strong></p>
