<p>I am the principal researcher at a robo-advisor company.</p> 
  
<p>For the past five years, I have been worked day and night at start-up, with the goal of sharing an asset management service that would otherwise be available only to a handful of institutional investors and a few wealthy individuals.</p>
   
<p>Driven by this goal, my team and I launched Korea’s first robo-advising service, which offers this financial advice service to all investors, including those who invest their hard-earned life savings with stakes as small as $200. The robo-advisor, born with the algorithm that I programmed, is immensely successful, with over one million users. The company grew as a result—from 20 to over 100 employees while its value increased nearly 200 times—stellar growth indeed (our company is now the largest in the market). As for me, I also grew as I authored five papers (while working) and secured patents for my algorithms. </p>
  
<p><strong>But I am only getting started.</strong></p>
