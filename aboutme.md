<p>“Hydrodynamic test facilities for wave basin and towing tanks”, “Towing Carriage System”, and “Blasting Robot” – these are the products that my family business, a company that my parents founded that tests vessels before they are actually sent off to the ocean, make. My father is the CEO, and our revenue amounts to at least $3 million per annum. The company even won the Republic of Korea President’s Award for transparency and excellence.</p>

<p>But we have no house of our own. In fact, we live in a rented house ($450/month), not by choice – we simply do not have the money.</p>

<p>All they own in this world is $20,000 (our bank account today) because two failures left us with nothing; our house was auctioned off cheap. And absolutely <em>everything</em> including my parents’ life savings was gone. Even after every furniture and other assets were sold off, still, we ended up with a $10 million debt. Since then, it has been a constant “battle”. Yes, our revenue may be impressive as we are in the scale business, but as we make smaller but exact replica of the port facilities and vessels, some that weigh over 160 tons, it costs a <em>fortune</em> to make them. Likewise, at least 90% of the revenue is spent to make these testing facilities, especially since they are high-tech facilities (technology costs significant capital) while the remaining 10% or so of the revenue goes to pay our five employees including our engineers. Thus, it is tough.</p>

<p>But we have each other.</p>

<p>In fact, this only brought us together even more: I say “even more” because these business failures did not change us a bit. We were a very close-knit loving family to begin with; my father, no matter how busy he was working for Samsung, a company known for its long work hours, he made time for us, whenever he could, studying insects together with us, assembling LEGO blocks, carrying out science experiments <em>together</em> with us and took us to the science fairs.</p>

<p>Thus, these painful failures did not crumble down the strong bond, the relationship we had built as a family for decades. We know that we have each other – that we can rely and count on each other. And, we stuck together. For example, my mother had to jump into the workforce, delivering milk and newspapers at dawn and working as a nanny in the evenings for two years. Honestly, this hurt because my mom was a nurse (a professional career woman) and had even been scouted by a talent agency in her heyday (her 20s), yet for a woman who was a stay-home mom for decades (sadly, home making still does not count as a career in Korea), she had no option but to take on these tough, physically demanding jobs. But she did it – for the family.</p> 

<p>With a mom like this, I too jumped in to “teamwork”. I thought about what I cannot do, what I do not have power over (for instance, I could not drop out of school to jump into workforce after all they had done for me to send me to the US to study plus, I had “presented” at least 100 times to them for this lifetime opportunity) but instead what I can do – graduate faster to save money on the hefty tuition. And that I did; I returned to Korea only after three years of study abroad, and even for a leadership program held in Italy during the last semester, I did not have to ask my parents for help as I saved down to bare bone. This way, I spared my parents from paying $40,000 which they then used to pay off the debt.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, so many lessons were learned; not to lose hope, optimism, and that fiery grit to overcome. My parents did not quit even when they had failed in their 40s, and although our assets are almost zero, still they take solace in zero debt as we paid it off after years of hard work.</p>

<p>But the greatest lesson was realizing the power of love. We stuck together because of our love for each other – and also because of our love for <em>life</em>. So, today, no matter how tired I am (after an all-nighter), I head out to volunteer. And because I realized the importance of money (how lack of it can hurt a family), I give my 500% of my effort to the development of Robo-Advisor and other advanced financial investment tools to protect the hard-earned money of the small investors.</p>

<p><strong>Now, I want more and I need you to grow first.</strong></p>
