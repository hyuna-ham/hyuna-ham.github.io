## Highlights

- We propose a simple and expandable deep learning model to verify the importance of variables in predicting the direction of intraday returns by adding an attention technique.
- We identify nonlinear relations between extended hour trading and intraday returns.
- Our study shows that a deep learning model is a tool for increasing the forecasting power and a useful method for interpreting the financial market.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Literature Review

Many studies have examined the relation between the past and future returns on a daily level. For instance, the relationship between overnight and daytime trading returns has been investigated (Cox and Peterson, 1994; Park, 1995; Berkman et al., 2012; Lou, Polk, and Skouras, 2019; Akbas et al., 2022; Ham, Ryu, and Webb, 2022). For example, Levi et al. (2018) divided overnight returns into aftermarket and premarket returns and studied the relationship between each return and the daytime trading returns. However, as most studies were conducted on a daily level, there are limitations in understanding the dynamics of financial markets on a minute or second level. Moreover, many studies used machine learning, but the majority of them focused only on increasing the accuracy of prediction (Obthong et al., 2020; Ferreira, Gandomi, and Cardoso, 2021). Studies that examine the relationship between the dynamics of extended hour trading and daytime trading returns using machine learning are scarce.
