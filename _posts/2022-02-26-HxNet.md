## Highlights

- I propose a simple and expandable deep learning model to verify the importance of variables in predicting the direction of intraday returns by adding an attention technique.
- I identify nonlinear relations between extended hour trading and intraday returns.
- This study shows that a deep learning model is a tool for increasing the forecasting power and a useful method for interpreting the financial market.



## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Literature Review
Many studies have examined the relation between the past and future returns on a daily level. For instance, the relationship between overnight and daytime trading returns has been investigated (Cox and Peterson, 1994; Park, 1995; Berkman et al., 2012; Lou, Polk, and Skouras, 2019; Akbas et al., 2022; Ham, Ryu, and Webb, 2022). For example, Levi et al. (2018) divided overnight returns into aftermarket and premarket returns and studied the relationship between each return and the daytime trading returns. However, as most studies were conducted on a daily level, there are limitations in understanding the dynamics of financial markets on a minute or second level. Moreover, studies used machine learning, but the majority of them focused only on increasing the accuracy of prediction (Obthong et al., 2020; Ferreira, Gandomi, and Cardoso, 2021). **In sum, studies that examine the relationship between the dynamics of extended hour trading and daytime trading returns using machine learning are scarce.**

### 1.2 Contribution
This study investigates the characteristics of the session data of extended hour trading that relate to intraday returns direction using a deep learning model with an attention technique, which has recently attracted attention. This study elaborately illuminates the underlying dynamics of the financial market. Furthermore, we propose HxNet to determine the characteristics of historical data of the extended hour trading sessions that are crucial for predicting future intraday returns. Our model can be used for intraday stock price data and stock data on various frequency levels. Moreover, the model can be applied to diverse time-series data, beyond stock prices. Furthermore, this study provides a guide for the use of machine learning in finance. Our model may not be a mere tool to increase the prediction rate, but a method to better understand the financial market by identifying the relationship between the nonlinear pattern of the past and future returns. We expect that our model contributes to establishing and developing a theory of financial economics.
