## Highlights

- I propose a simple and expandable deep learning model to verify the importance of variables in predicting the direction of intraday returns by adding an attention technique.
- I identify the nonlinear relationship between extended hour trading and intraday returns.
- This study shows that a deep learning model is a tool for increasing the forecasting power and a useful method for interpreting the financial market.




## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Literature Review
Many studies have examined the relationship between extended hour (or overnight) and daytime trading session returns (Cox and Peterson, 1994; Park, 1995; Berkman et al., 2012; Lou, Polk, and Skouras, 2019; Akbas et al., 2022; Ham, Ryu, and Webb, 2022). For instance, Levi et al. (2018) divided overnight returns into aftermarket and premarket returns and studied the relationship between each return and the daytime trading returns. However, as most studies were conducted on a daily level, there are limitations in understanding the dynamics of financial markets on a minute or second level. Moreover, studies use machine learning, but the majority of them focuses only on increasing the accuracy of prediction (Obthong et al., 2020; Ferreira, Gandomi, and Cardoso, 2021). **In sum, studies that examine the relationship between the dynamics of extended hour trading and daytime trading returns using machine learning are scarce.**

### 1.2 Contribution
I investigate the nonlinear relationship between extended hour trading and intraday returns using a deep learning model with an attention technique, which has recently attracted attention. This study contributes to elaborately illuminates the underlying dynamics of the financial market. Furthermore, I propose HxNet to determine the characteristics of historical data of the extended hour trading sessions that are important for predicting future intraday returns. This model can be used for intraday stock price data and stock data on various frequency levels. Moreover, the model can be applied to diverse time-series data, beyond stock prices. Furthermore, this study provides a guide for the use of machine learning in finance. This model may not be a mere tool to increase the prediction rate, but a method to better understand the financial market by identifying the relationship between the nonlinear pattern of the past and future returns.




## 2.	Methodology

### 2.1 Data
I collect data on stocks listed in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and Nasdaq National Market System (NMS) at least once since 2010 from the NYSE Trade and Quote (TAQ) database. 

### 2.2 Model
As demonstrated below, we will design a model to learn the nonlinear relationship between extended hour trading and intraday returns and find the significance of variables in the intraday return direction by adding attention to a deep learning structure. This model uses convolution layers that have the advantage of capturing features and adds an attention module for easy interpretation of results (which can be developed through experiments). I construct an attention structure as a module that has scalability to add it anywhere between neural network layers. This model is compared to existing models, such as regression and Convolutional Neural Networks, to evaluate its performance and determine the important features of the time-series for predicting future daytime trading session returns through attention weight.

### Note: Easy explanation on the concept of attention
Attention is a machine-learning method that mimics human attention and refers to crucial input parts. The methods used for attention have been extensive. You may refer to the photos below by Xu et al. (2015) for an in-depth understanding. The images show that the focus is placed on shapes corresponding to the underlined words. Thus, attention is a technique of letting a model concentrate on and refer to parts that are crucial for prediction.
