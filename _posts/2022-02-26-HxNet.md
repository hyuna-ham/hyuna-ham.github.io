## Highlights
- We propose a simple and expandable deep learning model to verify the importance of variables in predicting the direction of intraday returns by adding an attention technique.
- We identify nonlinear relations between extended hour trading and intraday returns.
- Our study shows that a deep learning model is a tool for increasing the forecasting power and a useful method for interpreting the financial market.
